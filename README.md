## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **XAMPP** or **WAMP** (for local development)
- **PHP 7.4+**
- **MySQL**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/kokan-katta-restaurant.git
    ```

2. Move the project folder to your web server's root directory (for XAMPP, it's `htdocs`):
    ```bash
    mv kokan-katta-restaurant /path-to-xampp/htdocs/
    ```

3. Start your web server (XAMPP/WAMP) and open PHPMyAdmin to create a new database:
    - Name the database: `kokan_katta`

4. Import the SQL file into your database:
    - Navigate to `phpmyadmin`, select the database, and use the **Import** feature to upload the `kokan_katta.sql` file provided in the `/database` folder of the project.

5. Configure environment variables:
    - Open the `config.php` file located in the `includes` directory and set the database credentials:
    ```php
    <?php
    define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
    define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
    define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
    define('DB_NAME', 'kokan_katta');
    ?>
    ```

6. Open your browser and visit:
    ```
    http://localhost/kokan-katta-restaurant
    ```

### Folder Structure

- `index.php`: Entry point of the application.
- `assets/`: Contains CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets.
- `includes/`: Contains PHP files for database connection and backend logic.
- `templates/`: Contains the reusable HTML templates for header, footer, and other components.
- `database/`: Contains the SQL file for setting up the database.

### Running the Application

1. Start your local web server (XAMPP/WAMP).
2. Ensure MySQL is running.
3. Access the website at `http://localhost/kokan-katta-restaurant`.

### Running the Tests

You can manually test the functionality of the site (e.g., placing orders, making reservations). Automated tests can be added later using PHP testing frameworks like **PHPUnit**.

## Deployment

To deploy the project on a live server:
1. Upload the project files to your web server using FTP (e.g., FileZilla) or deploy using cloud platforms (AWS, DigitalOcean).
2. Import the database to your live MySQL server.
3. Update `config.php` with the live database credentials.
4. Ensure file permissions are properly set on the server for PHP and MySQL to function correctly.
